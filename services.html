                <h3>How is it done?</h3>
                    <p>PDR technicians use specialized tools to massage the metal back into its original shape from behind the dent. Depending on the location of the damage, the panel is accessed by removing trim pieces, through window openings or by removing inner panels.
                    <br><br>
                    In a typical dent removal, the metal around the outside edge of the dent in slowly massaged back into its original position. The dent becomes progressively smaller as the technician works from the outside edge. Eventually the dent becomes so small it blends with the texture of the paint and disappears completely.
                <h3>How long does it take?</h3>

                <h3>Cost</h3>           
                    <p>Prices vary depending on the location and complexity of the repair. A general cost would be less than $100 for a single dime size dent, up to several hundred dollars to repair numerous dents on various body panels.
