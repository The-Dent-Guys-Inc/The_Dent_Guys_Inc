                <hr>
                <h3>With whom does The Dent Guys Inc do business?</h3>
                    <p>The Dent Guys inc customers include car dealerships, domestic and import automobile manufacturers, auto auctions, collision centers and body shops, rental car agencies, insurance companies, fleet owners and operators and individual vehicle owners.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>What is paintless dent removal (PDR)?</h3>
                    <p>Paintless Dent Removal repairs dents and dings on vehicles without affecting the original factory finish. Dings and dents can come from everything from runaway shopping carts to hail storms. Whatever the cause, technicians use specially designed tools to reform body metal back to its original condition.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>How long does it take to remove a dent or ding?</h3>
                    <p>Most dents and dings can often be repaired in a day or less. Vehicles damaged by hail generally are repaired within two to three days.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>How much does it cost to repair a ding or dent?</h3>
                    <p>It depends on the size, location and complexity of the damage. The average dent, like one made by a golf ball, should cost less than $100 to repair. Whatever the damage, PDR consistently costs about 1/3 as much as traditional body shop repairs.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Is all PDR the same?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely not. The Dent Guys Inc trained technicians do PDR better and more quickly than other PDR providers. Their training program is the most extensive in the business. The Dent Guys inc pioneered the PDR process and has remained ahead of the curve ever since, consistently developing superior approaches to the challenge of repairing dings and dents. And our hail team is second to none in terms of responsiveness and quality of work. Its no wonder The Dent Guys Inc is the approved and preferred PDR vendor for major automobile manufacturers, dealers, insurers and leasing and rental companies.</p>
