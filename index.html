                <li><p>"Highly recommend this company for any small dents or door dings in your vehicle. They are super friendly, informative and make the whole process as worry free as possible! ... Couldn't be happier with how it turned out. They were also quick and came right to my house to do the repair."<br>- James Wertz</p></li>
                <li><p>"I am shocked at how great my car looks. It got hit really hard with hail. Even the tops of the doors. I could not even count how many dents my car had all over it. They got everything out and charged me less than what my insurance company paid me. My car is important to me since I lead funeral processions with it. I could not be happier with Matt and everyone else who worked on my car."<br>- Brent Francis, Parkview Funeral Home, Parkville</p></li>
                <li><p>"I stopped by The Dent Guys today because I have a brand new vehicle that someone dented the back drivers door. Alex had the dent out within minutes! He was very kind and also informative explaining what he was doing. I would definitely recommend to friends and family! Thanks again Alex!!"<br>- Deborah Sotirakos</p></li>
